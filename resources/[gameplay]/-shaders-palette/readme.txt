Mail: knoblauch700@o2.pl

Update 0.5:
-applied a chromatic aberation effect (disabled as default) 
-added exported functions to control the effects
-added an exported function to change the palette texture

Update 0.3:
-Layered effect - works with other full scren effects now.
-Switching the effect with /sPalette

This resource does exactly what enbseries palette effect does.
Supports any enb palette bitmap.

Uploaded it for those wanting to create their own shader system or
just adding a bit of atmosphere on their servers.

It's fairly easy to add other post process effects. And that's
all up to You.

That's it.
